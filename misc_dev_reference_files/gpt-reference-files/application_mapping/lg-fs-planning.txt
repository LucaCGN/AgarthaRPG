# Game Development Plan

## Phase 1: Database Design and Initial Data Loading

### Tasks:

1. **Design Firestore Schema**
    - Define collections and documents for game data (e.g., quests, items, NPCs).
    - Define collections and documents for user-specific data (e.g., character stats, inventory).

2. **Initial Data for Testing**
    - Create JSON files or scripts to populate Firestore with initial game data for main features, introduction, and Act 1.

3. **Content Creation and Loading**
    - Generate any missing game content (e.g., quest descriptions, NPC dialogues).
    - Load this content into Firestore.

### Considerations:

- **Security Rules**: Implement Firestore security rules to protect game data.
- **Optimization**: Use compound queries for efficient data retrieval.

## Phase 2: User-Specific Document Mapping

### Tasks:

1. **Character Creation Documents**
    - Define the logic for generating documents during character creation (e.g., stats, inventory).

2. **LLM Chain-Generated Documents**
    - Map out which documents will be generated or modified by the LLM chains and when (e.g., quest progress, dialog history).

3. **Data Fetching and Processing**
    - Identify when to fetch data using Python logic.
    - Identify when to fetch and process data using LLM chains.

### Considerations:

- **Real-time Updates**: Use Firestoreâ€™s real-time listeners for features like chat and stats updates.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks in Cloud Functions and log errors.

## Phase 3: Application Flow Mapping

1. **User-LLM-Database Interaction**
    - Create a flowchart or state diagram to map the interactions between the user, LLM chains, and Firestore.

---

## Phase 4: Backend Development

### Tasks:

1. **LLM Chain Coding**
    - Implement each LLM chain in Python to read/write to Firestore according to the mapped functions.

2. **Prompt Fetching**
    - Fetch the prompt for the main chains, allowing the LLM to call functions and summarize outputs before returning to the user.

### Considerations:

- **Monitoring**: Use Firebase Analytics and Cloud Monitoring for performance tracking.
- **Deployment**: Automate Cloud Function deployments via Firebase CLI or GitHub Actions.

---

## Phase 5: Terminal-Based Testing

1. **Test Environment Setup**
    - Develop a terminal version of the game connected to Firestore for testing and tuning game mechanics.
