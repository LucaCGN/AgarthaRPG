# Role of Magic Guilds in the Economy

Magic Guilds play a pivotal role in the magic-based economies of the world, influencing various aspects such as production, distribution, consumption, and trade.

## Production and Distribution of Elemental Crystals

Magic Guilds control the production and distribution of Elemental Crystals, the key resource in magic-based economies. Different guilds specialize in different types of crystals, based on their magical focus and geographical location. 

The abundance or scarcity of certain types of crystals in a region can greatly influence the local economy, affecting the types of goods produced, the professions that thrive, and the overall wealth of the region. 

## Trade Routes and Economic Exchange

Magic Guilds maintain and protect Trade Routes, facilitating the exchange of goods, services, and information. These routes are vital for the trade of Elemental Crystals and other magic-based products, connecting different regions and guilds. 

Guilds that control strategic Trade Routes can wield significant economic power, influencing prices, availability of goods, and inter-regional relationships.

## Magic Guilds as Economic Entities

Magic Guilds function as economic entities, engaging in various business activities. They offer magic-based services, sell magic products, and invest in research and development. The economic success of a guild can impact its influence and power within the larger societal structure.

## Global Magic Organization (GMO) and Rogue Guilds

All Magic Guilds are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Global Magic Organization (GMO). The GMO sets standards, enforces regulations, and mediates disputes among guilds.

Guilds that choose not to affiliate with the GMO are considered Rogue Guilds. These guilds operate outside the established economic and regulatory systems, often engaging in black market activities. While they can be economically successful, they also face significant risks and challenges due to their rogue status.

## Cities and Civilization

Cities and civilizations have their roots in the organization of Magic Guilds. The establishment of a guild often leads to the growth of a community around it, eventually developing into a city. 

Cities are typically ruled by a triad of the most powerful guilds, with 'power' defined by various factors such as wealth, knowledge, or magical strength. The interplay of these guilds shapes the economic, political, and social landscape of the city.
