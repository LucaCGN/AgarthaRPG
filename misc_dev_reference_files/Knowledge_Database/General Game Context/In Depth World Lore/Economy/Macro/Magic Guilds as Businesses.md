#  Magic Guilds as Businesses

In the world where magic forms the core of all institutions, Magic Guilds are not merely centers of learning and regulation but are akin to corporations. Their operations encompass all aspects of society, including commerce, governance, healthcare, and more.

## Commercial Operations

Magic Guilds engage in a variety of commercial activities. They produce magic-based products, offer magical services, and maintain trade routes. Guilds that specialize in certain types of Elemental Crystals may sell these crystals or magic items made from them. Others might offer services such as magical healing, transportation, or construction. 

## Governance

Magic Guilds are also involved in governance. Cities are typically ruled by a triad of the most powerful guilds, which might be determined by their wealth, knowledge, or magical power. These guilds make decisions that impact the economic, political, and social aspects of the city. 

## Healthcare

Healthcare, particularly magical healing, is often provided by Magic Guilds specializing in this area. These guilds run healing centers, produce healing potions and artifacts, and offer services of skilled healers. 

## Research and Development

One of the key business activities of Magic Guilds is research and development. Guilds invest in the development of new spells, the discovery of new Elemental Crystals, and the creation of new magic-based products and services. The outcomes of this research can lead to new business opportunities and contribute to the guild's economic success.

## Regulatory Compliance and Rogue Guilds

All Magic Guilds are subject to regulations set by the Global Magic Organization (GMO). Compliance with these regulations is crucial for their business operations. However, some guilds choose to operate outside this system, becoming Rogue Guilds. These guilds may engage in black market activities, presenting both opportunities and risks.
