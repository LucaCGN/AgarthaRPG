# Shinobi

## Role
Shinobis in Agartha are masters of stealth and precision. While they are prevalent in rogue guilds, their skills are utilized for a variety of legal and necessary tasks in the realm, such as surveillance, espionage, and occasionally, discreet intervention.

## Process
Shinobis undergo rigorous training to hone their skills of stealth, agility, and precision. Their work process often involves:

- **Stealth Operations**: Shinobis are experts in remaining unseen and unheard. They can infiltrate heavily guarded places, bypass security measures, and escape without leaving a trace.

- **Information Gathering**: Shinobis are often employed to gather sensitive information, making them valuable assets in political maneuverings and business dealings.

- **Discreet Intervention**: In certain situations, a subtle approach is necessary to resolve conflicts or remove threats. Shinobis excel in this, using their stealth and precision to achieve their objectives without disrupting the status quo.

## Economic Value
Despite their covert nature, Shinobis play a critical role in the realm's economy. Information gathered by Shinobis can influence trade, politics, and military strategy, affecting the economic landscape of Agartha.
