# Farmer

## Role
Farmers in Agartha play a crucial role in the extraction of magical resources by cultivating plants and crops that possess magical properties. Their role is to nurture and harvest these magical plants, which are used in the creation of potions, spell components, and alchemical concoctions.

## Process
The process of farming involves a deep understanding of magical plants and their growth requirements. Farmers carefully select and cultivate seeds or saplings of magical plants, providing them with the optimal conditions for growth. They employ various techniques such as elemental irrigation, soil enchantments, and plant-specific rituals to enhance the magical properties of the plants. Once the plants have matured, farmers harvest them, ensuring the preservation of their magical qualities.

## Economic Value
Farmers contribute significantly to the magical economy of Agartha by providing a steady supply of magical plants. These plants are essential ingredients for potions, spellcasting, and alchemical creations. The demand for magical plants is high among alchemists, herbalists, and potion-makers, making the work of farmers invaluable in meeting the needs of these professions.
