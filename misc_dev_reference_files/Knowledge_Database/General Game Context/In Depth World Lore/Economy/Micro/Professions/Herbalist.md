- **Potion Crafting**: The crafting of potions involves meticulous blending of the harvested herbs with the refined crystals. The resulting potions can have a variety of effects, from healing to enhancing abilities, depending on the ingredients used.

## Economic Value
Herbalists contribute significantly to Agartha's economy through their crafting of specialized potions. These potions cater to a wide range of needs, from healing injuries to enhancing abilities, making them integral to both everyday life and adventuring.
