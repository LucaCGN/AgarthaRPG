# Cartographer

## Role
Cartographers in Agartha are skilled geographers responsible for creating detailed and accurate maps of the world. Their work extends beyond mere geography; they also document the magical ley lines, crystal deposits, elemental regions, and other mystical aspects of the terrain.

## Process
Cartographers undertake extensive travels and rigorous research to create their maps. They must have a deep understanding of both the physical and magical aspects of Agartha's geography. This includes:

- **Physical Geography**: This includes mountains, rivers, forests, and other natural features. Cartographers must accurately represent these features on their maps.

- **Magical Geography**: Cartographers also document the less tangible aspects of the world, such as the locations of crystal deposits, magical ley lines, and regions with particular elemental affinities. 

## Economic Value
The work of Cartographers is critical to many aspects of life in Agartha. Adventurers rely on their maps for navigation and planning expeditions. Miners use them to locate crystal deposits. Alchemists, Herbalists, and Librarians may also use their maps to locate resources or areas of magical significance.
