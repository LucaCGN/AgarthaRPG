# Merchant

## Role
Merchants in Agartha are the lifeblood of the realm's economy, acting as the connective thread that links all other professions. They are traders, negotiators, and entrepreneurs, dealing in a variety of goods from elemental crystals to magical scrolls, potions, and crafted items. 

## Process
Merchants operate in numerous ways, depending on their resources, connections, and chosen markets. Their activities often include:

- **Trading**: Merchants buy and sell a variety of goods, balancing supply and demand to profit from their transactions. They must have a deep understanding of their products and the needs of their customers.

- **Negotiating**: A key skill for any Merchant is negotiation. They must be able to secure the best possible deals, whether buying supplies from Miners or selling potions to Adventurers. 

- **Entrepreneurship**: Many Merchants run their own businesses, managing everything from procurement to sales. This requires a broad skill set, including finance, management, and customer service.

## Economic Value
Merchants play a pivotal role in Agartha's economy. They facilitate the distribution of goods, ensuring that crystals mined from the earth reach the Alchemists who can refine them, and that the potions crafted by Herbalists find their way to the Adventurers who need them. Their activities help to maintain the flow of goods and currency in the realm.
