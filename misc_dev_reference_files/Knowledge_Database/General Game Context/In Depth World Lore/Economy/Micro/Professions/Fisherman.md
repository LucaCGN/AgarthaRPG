# Fisherman

## Role
Fishermen in Agartha are skilled in the art of catching magical creatures that inhabit the rivers, lakes, and oceans of the realm. Their role is to use their expertise in fishing techniques and knowledge of magical creatures to capture and harvest rare aquatic resources.

## Process
The process of fishing involves a combination of skill, patience, and magical attunement. Fishermen utilize various fishing techniques, including netting, angling, and trapping, to catch magical creatures. They are knowledgeable about the habitats and behaviors of these creatures, allowing them to target specific species. Once caught, the fishermen carefully handle and process the creatures to extract valuable resources such as scales, bones, and magical essences.

## Economic Value
Fishermen contribute to the magical economy of Agartha by providing a unique and valuable resource: rare aquatic materials. These materials are used in the creation of potions, magical artifacts, and even as ingredients in culinary delicacies. The demand for these resources is high among alchemists, enchanters, and chefs, making the work of fishermen essential in meeting the needs of these professions.
