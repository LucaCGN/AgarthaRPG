# Librarian

## Role
Librarians in Agartha are the guardians of ancient knowledge, illuminating and preserving manuscripts using 'Light' and 'Time' crystals. Their role extends beyond preservation, as they are tasked with the production of magical scrolls by embedding refined crystals, allowing for the channeling of spells or the creation of magical items.

## Process
The process of creating magical scrolls involves two main steps: decoding ancient magic to control current elemental energy and then imbuing the scrolls with the refined crystals. This intricate process requires a deep understanding of the elemental nature of the crystals and the ancient knowledge contained in the manuscripts.

- **Decoding Ancient Magic**: Librarians use 'Light' and 'Time' crystals to illuminate ancient texts, reveal hidden knowledge and decode ancient magic. This allows them to understand and control elemental energy.
  
- **Imbuing Scrolls**: After decoding the magic, Librarians then embed the refined crystals into scrolls. This transforms the scrolls into conduits for channeling spells or creating magical items.

## Economic Value
The economic value of Librarians lies in their ability to produce magical scrolls and their integral role in the magical item production chain. By providing a means to channel spells and create magical items, they contribute significantly to Agartha's magical economy.
