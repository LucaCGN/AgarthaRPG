# Alchemist

## Role
Alchemists in Agartha are master artisans who refine and amplify the power of elemental crystals. Their expertise lies in enhancing a crystal's inherent properties and elevating its rarity to unlock powerful abilities. 

## Process
The process of alchemy involves a deep understanding of the elemental nature of crystals and a skillful manipulation of their qualities. Alchemists work with four levels of crystal rarity: Normal, Rare, Special, and Legendary. 

- **Normal Crystals**: These crystals possess basic elemental properties. 
- **Rare Crystals**: The alchemist amplifies the primary function of the crystal and unlocks a new secondary ability. 
- **Special Crystals**: The primary and secondary functions of the crystal are enhanced.
- **Legendary Crystals**: A unique legendary action is unlocked, a power that can be game-changing. 

## Economic Value
The work of alchemists is pivotal to the magical economy of Agartha. The refined and amplified crystals they produce are essential materials in various professions, particularly for Librarians and Herbalists.
