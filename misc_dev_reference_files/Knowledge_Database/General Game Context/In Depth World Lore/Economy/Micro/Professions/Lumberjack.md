# Lumberjack

## Role
Lumberjacks in Agartha are skilled individuals who specialize in harvesting magical wood from the ancient forests of the realm. Their role is to identify specific trees that possess magical properties and carefully fell them to preserve the integrity of the wood.

## Process
The process of lumberjacking involves a combination of knowledge, precision, and respect for the natural world. Lumberjacks venture into the ancient forests of Agartha, where they identify trees with magical properties based on their appearance, energy, and connection to the elemental forces. They use their expertise in tree felling techniques to bring down the selected trees while minimizing damage to the surrounding environment. The harvested magical wood is then carefully processed and prepared for use in various crafts.

## Economic Value
Lumberjacks play a crucial role in the magical economy of Agartha by providing a valuable resource: magical wood. This wood is highly sought after by carpenters, wand makers, and other craftsmen who use it to create enchanted items, furniture, and structures. The unique properties of magical wood make it a prized material, and the work of lumberjacks ensures a sustainable supply for the thriving magical economy.
