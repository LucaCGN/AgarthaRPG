## Crystal Uses

### Energy Generation

Crystals such as Wind, Lightning, and Fire provide power for wind turbines, electricity generation, and fuel for fire-based machinery, respectively.

### Agriculture

Agriculture benefits from Water Crystals for purifying water supplies and providing moisture, Earth Crystals for fertilizing soil, and Wood Crystals for enhancing plant growth.

### Healthcare

Healthcare relies on different Elemental Crystals for numerous medical applications, such as Ice Crystals for cryotherapy, Lightning Crystals for defibrillators, and Light Crystals for light therapy.

### Communication

Communication is revolutionized by Sound and Lightning Crystals, which facilitate communication devices, systems, and advanced technology.

### Transportation

In transportation, Metal Crystals are used for reinforcing metallic structures and improving transportation systems like railroads, while Gravity Crystals enable cargo lifting applications and stabilize structures and vehicles.

### Research and Exploration

Elemental Crystals also play a vital role in research and exploration, such as Time Crystals in temporal manipulation and Gravity Crystals in advanced physics and space exploration.

## Cultural Impact

Elemental Crystals also contribute to the world's art and culture, as seen in the creation of ice sculptures with Ice Crystals, decorative items and jewelry with Crystal Crystals, and illusions and visual effects with Shadow Crystals.

## Economic Impact

Given their significance and the wide range of applications, Elemental Crystals are an essential resource that drives the world's economy and influences the daily lives of its inhabitants.

## Engineering Limitations

While elemental crystals can be used in a wide range of engineering applications, their assembly is not simple. The engineering knowledge exists in this world, but it has not advanced as far as in our own reality. This limitation further reinforces the importance of specialized guilds and the necessity for trade routes to transport these valuable resources throughout Agartha.
