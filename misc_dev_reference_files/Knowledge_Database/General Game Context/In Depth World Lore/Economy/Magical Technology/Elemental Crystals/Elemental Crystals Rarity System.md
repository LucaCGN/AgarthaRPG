# Elemental Crystals in Agartha: Rarity, Utility, and Influence

## Introduction

Elemental Crystals, often considered the lifeblood of Agartha, serve myriad purposes, from powering industries to shaping cultures. Their inherent magical properties, when harnessed, can bring about transformative changes across sectors. Moreover, the art of refining these crystals to enhance their potency adds another layer of complexity and value to them.

## Rarity and Refinement

Elemental Crystals come in varying rarities:
- **Common**: These are the most abundant and have basic elemental properties. For instance, a common Water Crystal merely produces water.
  
- **Uncommon**: Refined by alchemists by combining multiple common crystals. They possess enhanced properties. An uncommon Water Crystal, for example, can produce a directed pump of water.

- **Rare**: Further refined and more potent than their uncommon counterparts.
  
- **Epic**: These crystals are exceptionally potent and have been refined multiple times to concentrate their elemental power.
  
- **Legendary**: The pinnacle of crystal refinement. Their powers and applications are unparalleled.

Alchemists play a pivotal role in this hierarchy, refining crystals to control their magical output and concentrate their inherent power. This refinement not only amplifies the crystal's potency but also tailors its properties for specific applications.

## Sources

Elemental Crystals primarily originate from magical beasts. However, some rare elemental environments also sporadically yield these coveted resources.
