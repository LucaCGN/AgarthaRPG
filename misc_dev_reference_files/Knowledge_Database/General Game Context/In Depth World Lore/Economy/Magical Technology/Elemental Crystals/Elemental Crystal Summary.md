# Elemental Crystals - The Essence of Agartha

## Introduction

Elemental Crystals are a fundamental aspect of the world, deeply ingrained in its economy, society, and daily life.

## Sources

These crystals are predominantly sourced from magical beasts and, to a lesser extent, from extreme and rare elemental environments.

## Applications

Elemental Crystals have a myriad of applications, such as:
- Consumption for restoring Mana Pools or granting unique effects.
- Crafting and imbuing magical items.
- Serving as essential components for alchemical creations.

## Cultural and Economic Impact

Beyond their practical applications, Elemental Crystals shape Agartha's art, culture, and economy. From ice sculptures, decorative jewelry, to the creation of mesmerizing illusions, they influence creative expressions. Economically, their significance cannot be understated. They form the backbone of trade, influence market dynamics, and underpin the prosperity of cities and guilds.

## Engineering Limitations

While the potential of Elemental Crystals is vast, harnessing them is no simple feat. The engineering knowledge of Agartha, although advanced, hasn't reached the zenith found in other realities. This constraint emphasizes the indispensable roles of specialized guilds and the establishment of intricate trade routes to disseminate these precious resources across the world.
