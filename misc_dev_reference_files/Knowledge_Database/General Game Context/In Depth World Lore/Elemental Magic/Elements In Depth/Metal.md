## Metal

**Element Definition**: Metal is a solid material characterized by its strength, durability, and conductivity. It is a versatile element that can be shaped and manipulated by skilled individuals.

### Element Interactions

- **Nullify**: Metal nullifies Electricity-based magic, as metal conducts electricity and can dissipate electrical currents. Electricity nullifies Metal by melting and deforming it with high voltage.
- **Combine**: Metal combines with Fire to create Molten Metal, a sub-element that encompasses the liquefied and malleable state of metal when exposed to intense heat.
- **Amplify**: Metal amplifies Earth-based magic, as metal can be used to reinforce and stabilize earth structures. Earth amplifies Metal by providing a source of raw materials for metal production.
- **Weaken**: Metal weakens Wood-based magic, as metal can cut through and destroy wooden structures. Wood weakens Metal by absorbing moisture and causing corrosion.
- **No Interaction**: Metal does not interact significantly with Water, Sand, Ice, Spirit, Shadow, Time, Gravity, Chaos, Ink, or Sound.
