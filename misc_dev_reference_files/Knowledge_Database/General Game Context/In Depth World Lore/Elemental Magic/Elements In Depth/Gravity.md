## Gravity

**Element Definition**: Gravity is a fundamental force that governs the attraction between objects with mass. In Agartha, Gravity is an element that allows the user to manipulate gravitational forces and possess abilities related to control over gravity.

### Element Interactions

- **Nullify**: Gravity nullifies Time-based magic, as the manipulation of gravity can affect the flow and perception of time. Time nullifies Gravity by altering the progression of events and the effects of gravitational forces.
- **Combine**: Gravity combines with Electricity to create Magnetism, a sub-element that encompasses the manipulation of electromagnetic forces and gravitational fields.
- **Amplify**: Gravity amplifies Metal-based magic, as the manipulation of gravity can affect the movement and behavior of metallic objects. Metal amplifies Gravity by providing a source of mass and density for gravitational manipulation.
- **Weaken**: Gravity weakens Sand-based magic, as the manipulation of gravity can destabilize and disperse loose sand particles. Sand weakens Gravity by absorbing and dispersing gravitational forces.
- **No Interaction**: Gravity does not interact significantly with Ice, Fire, Water, Earth, Poison, Spirit, Shadow, Ink, Chaos, or Sound.

### Elemental Interactions in Agartha

In Agartha, Gravity is known for its association with the manipulation of gravitational forces. Skilled Gravity users can control the gravitational pull, alter the weight and trajectory of objects, and possess abilities related to mobility and aerial combat. Additionally, Gravity users have an enhanced sense of balance and can navigate environments with ease.

### Imbuement Magic

In Imbuement Magic, Gravity can be infused into objects or weapons to imbue them with gravitational properties. For example, boots imbued with Gravity can enhance the user's jumping ability and allow them to manipulate their own gravitational pull.

### Gear Magic

In Gear Magic, Gravity can be channeled within the user's body to enhance their mobility and control over gravitational forces. This can result in increased agility, the ability to manipulate the gravitational pull on themselves or others, and the power to create localized gravitational fields. A Gravity user utilizing Gear Magic can perform acrobatic maneuvers, control the trajectory of projectiles, and even create temporary anti-gravity zones.

### Materialization Magic

In Materialization Magic, Gravity users can materialize constructs or create objects infused with gravitational energies. These constructs can be used for various purposes, such as creating gravitational barriers, manipulating the gravitational pull in a localized area, or even creating temporary black holes.

### Manipulation Magic

In Manipulation Magic, Gravity users can manipulate and control gravitational forces, altering the weight, trajectory, and behavior of objects. They can increase or decrease the gravitational pull, create gravitational fields, or even levitate and fly. Skilled Gravity users can also manipulate the gravitational forces around others, affecting their movement and balance.

### Other Notes

Gravity is often associated with the attraction between objects and the sense of weight and balance. Gravity users are known for their ability to manipulate and control gravitational forces, altering the behavior of objects and affecting the movement of themselves and others. They have a deep understanding of the properties and behavior of gravitational forces, allowing them to utilize them for various magical applications, including mobility, aerial combat, and manipulation of weight and trajectory.
