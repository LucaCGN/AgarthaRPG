## Ice

**Element Definition**: Ice is a rare elemental force associated with the manipulation and control of cold temperatures. It manifests as frozen water and can be harnessed and controlled by skilled individuals.

### Element Interactions

- **Nullify**: Ice nullifies Fire-based magic, as it can extinguish flames and absorb heat. Fire nullifies Ice by melting and evaporating ice.
- **Combine**: Ice combines with Water to create Frost, a sub-element that encompasses icy terrain and freezing temperatures.
- **Amplify**: Ice amplifies Water-based magic, as it can freeze and solidify water into ice. Water amplifies Ice by providing a source of moisture and enhancing its freezing abilities.
- **Weaken**: Ice weakens Wind/Air-based magic, as it can freeze and solidify air currents. Wind/Air weakens Ice by dispersing and disrupting cold temperatures.
- **No Interaction**: Ice does not interact significantly with Earth, Metal, Poison, Electricity, Wood, Spirit, Shadow, Time, Gravity, Chaos, Ink, or Sound.

### Elemental Interactions in Agartha

In Agartha, Ice is known for its ability to manipulate and control cold temperatures. Skilled Ice users can create ice constructs, freeze objects and surfaces, and even create blizzards or icy storms. Additionally, Ice users have enhanced resistance to cold temperatures and can withstand freezing environments.

### Imbuement Magic

In Imbuement Magic, Ice can be infused into objects or living beings to imbue them with icy properties. For example, a staff imbued with Ice can unleash freezing blasts that can encase targets in ice or create slippery surfaces.

### Gear Magic

In Gear Magic, Ice can be channeled within the user's body to enhance their physical and mental capabilities. This can result in increased resistance to cold, enhanced agility on icy surfaces, and the ability to create and manipulate ice. An Ice user utilizing Gear Magic can create ice weapons, freeze opponents, and create ice barriers for defense.

### Materialization Magic

In Materialization Magic, Ice users can materialize ice-based entities or create constructs made of solid ice. These entities can create freezing attacks, manipulate ice formations, or provide a source of cold and moisture in arid environments.

### Manipulation Magic

In Manipulation Magic, Ice users can manipulate existing ice and control its shape, temperature, and movement. They can create ice walls, freeze water bodies, or even create ice bridges for traversal. Additionally, Ice users have an innate sense of cold temperatures and can detect changes in thermal energy.

### Other Notes

Ice is often associated with cold, preservation, and stillness. Ice users are known for their ability to manipulate and control freezing temperatures, using them for offense, defense, and environmental manipulation. They have enhanced resistance to cold and can create icy environments even in the most inhospitable conditions.
