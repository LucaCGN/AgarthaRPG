- **Combine**: Sound combines with Electricity to create Sonic Shockwave, a sub-element that encompasses powerful sonic blasts and electrical discharges.
- **Amplify**: Sound amplifies Spirit-based magic, as it can resonate with spiritual energies and enhance their effects. Spirit amplifies Sound by providing a conduit for sound waves to travel through.
