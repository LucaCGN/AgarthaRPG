## Magnetism

**Element Definition**: Magnetism is a rare elemental force associated with the manipulation and control of magnetic fields. It manifests as the ability to attract or repel metallic objects and can be harnessed and controlled by skilled individuals.

### Element Interactions

- **Nullify**: Magnetism nullifies Metal-based magic, as it can disrupt and manipulate metallic structures. Metal nullifies Magnetism by resisting and redirecting magnetic forces.
- **Combine**: Magnetism combines with Electricity to create Electromagnetism, a sub-element that encompasses the manipulation of both magnetic and electrical energies.
- **Amplify**: Magnetism amplifies Gravity-based magic, as it can influence the gravitational pull on metallic objects. Gravity amplifies Magnetism by providing a stronger force for magnetic manipulation.
- **Weaken**: Magnetism weakens Wind/Air-based magic, as it can disrupt and redirect air currents. Wind/Air weakens Magnetism by dispersing and disrupting magnetic fields.
- **No Interaction**: Magnetism does not interact significantly with Water, Fire, Earth, Ice, Poison, Wood, Spirit, Shadow, Time, Chaos, Ink, or Sound.

### Elemental Interactions in Agartha

In Agartha, Magnetism is known for its ability to manipulate and control magnetic fields. Skilled Magnetism users can attract or repel metallic objects, create magnetic barriers, and even manipulate the movement of metallic projectiles. Additionally, Magnetism users have enhanced sensitivity to magnetic fields and can detect and analyze metallic objects in their surroundings.

### Imbuement Magic

In Imbuement Magic, Magnetism can be infused into objects or living beings to imbue them with magnetic properties. For example, a gauntlet imbued with Magnetism can attract or repel metallic objects, allowing the wearer to manipulate their surroundings.

### Gear Magic

In Gear Magic, Magnetism can be channeled within the user's body to enhance their physical and mental capabilities. This can result in increased strength when interacting with metallic objects, heightened senses to detect magnetic fields, and the ability to create magnetic pulses. A Magnetism user utilizing Gear Magic can manipulate metallic weapons, create magnetic shields, or even levitate metallic objects.

### Materialization Magic

In Materialization Magic, Magnetism users can materialize constructs made of pure magnetic energy. These constructs can create magnetic barriers, generate magnetic pulses, or provide a source of magnetic attraction or repulsion.

### Manipulation Magic

In Manipulation Magic, Magnetism users can manipulate existing magnetic fields and control their strength, direction, and influence. They can attract or repel metallic objects, create magnetic disturbances, or even disrupt electronic devices. Additionally, Magnetism users have an innate sense of magnetic fields and can detect and analyze metallic objects and their magnetic properties.

### Other Notes

Magnetism is often associated with attraction, repulsion, and manipulation. Magnetism users are known for their ability to manipulate and control magnetic fields, using them for offense, defense, and environmental manipulation. They have enhanced sensitivity to magnetic fields and can navigate and interact with metallic objects with precision.
