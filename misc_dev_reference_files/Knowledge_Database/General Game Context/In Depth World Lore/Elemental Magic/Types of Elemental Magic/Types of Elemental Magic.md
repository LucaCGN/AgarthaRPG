In the mystical land of Agartha, elemental magic is more than just the manifestation of raw power; it's an intricate dance of channeling, imbuing, and crafting. This complexity is depicted in the various ways elemental magic is harnessed and employed. Below is an overview of the five primary methods through which elemental magic is used:
