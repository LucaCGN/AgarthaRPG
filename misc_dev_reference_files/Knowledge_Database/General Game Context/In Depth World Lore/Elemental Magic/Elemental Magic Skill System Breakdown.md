## Summary

In this skill system, characters progress through a tiered system of elemental mastery. As they advance, they gain access to more elements and archetypes, culminating in powerful ultimate skills that harness the synergy of all three chosen elements or the full capabilities of a single element.

## Skill Tree

### First Block (Tier 1)

Contains nodes with one element and one archetype, offering basic skills.  
Example: light node - basic healing spell.

### Second Block (Tier 2)

Contains nodes with two elements and skills that combine two archetypes.  
Example: light-wind node - healing spell with a gust of wind that pushes enemies away.

### Third Block (Tier 3)

Contains nodes with three elements, offering skills that combine all three archetypes and also introduces "Ultimates" - powerful skills that optimize all three elements for a single potent effect.  
Example: light-wind-sound node - a grand healing spell with wind damage that deafens, and as an ultimate: a blinding flash and deafening bang with strong winds to completely disorient enemies.

## Effects

As characters progress, they unlock a variety of effects such as attack, defense, heal, CC, movement speed, extra action, repositioning, AoE vs single target, and status boosts.

## Character Archetypes

Characters evolve from basic roles to multifaceted masters, transitioning from healers to damage dealers and tanks based on their chosen skills and elements.

## Player Choice

Players can choose elements, skills, and archetypes to create unique characters, with the freedom to mix and match as they progress. That is not a fixed system but an AI-powered one. The AI will both analyze passively how the user plays and synergy with his weapon, stats, and profession choice while crafting new skills, and the user can actively describe skills he would like to train and learn to the AI.

## LLM Generation

Generates unique skills based on elements, playstyle, archetype, and tier.

## Examples of Characters

### Tier 1 Characters

Limited to 1 element and 1 archetype.  
Example: Light mage - Basic healer with simple light-based healing spells.

### Tier 2 Characters

Can combine 2 elements and 2 archetypes.  
Examples:
- Fire-metal mage: A damage dealer and tank, using fire for offense and metal for defense.
- Wind-sound mage: A healer and damage dealer, using wind for healing and sound for offense.

### Tier 3 Characters

Combine 3 elements and 3 archetypes, with access to ultimates.  
Examples:
- Light-wind-sound mage: A master of healing, damage, and tanking. Ultimate: A blinding flash and deafening bang with strong winds to completely disorient enemies.
- Fire-metal-magnetism mage: A master of damage, tanking, and control. Ultimate: A fiery explosion that pulls enemies in and encases them in metal.
- Spirit-chaos-wood mage: A master of healing, control, and tanking. Ultimate: A spiritual aura that sows chaos among enemies and fortifies allies with wooden shields.

## Tiered Progression

Tiered progression allows characters to evolve from basic elemental users to grandmasters, offering a rewarding journey of growth and specialization.

## Trade-off Between Elemental Skill Power and Variety

In this world, there are two different ways of mastering your elements:
1. Learning to use it in different ways and master a variety of magic.
2. Master fewer magic and make them more powerful.

This system allows a diplomat or merchant to focus on having a myriad of utility skills while lumberjacks, seamen, and other types of professions who venture into the wild and have a physical-based profession might have fewer but more powerful magic.

## Game Progression

When the player gets to have time to rest, he can instead of replenishing his resources, choose to train or try to learn a new ability. The success is guaranteed, but how many tries/"training sections" it takes depends on the dice roll.

## Lore Context on Human and Elemental Magic

Humans are not born inherently with elemental magic, but somehow, the Global Magic System found a way to use small fragments of the primordial crystal, which are kept in possession of each city master guild, to activate elemental affinity on human beings.

## Resources System for Elemental Magic Skill System

Each elemental magic skill has 2 resources. Focus and Mana. Mana scales based on the resource consumption of the skill and Focus based on concentration/complexity of the skill.
