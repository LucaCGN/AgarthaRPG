It emphasizes strategic planning through a Declaration Phase, followed by an Execution Phase. Participants, including both the player and NPCs, have a set number of Action Points (AP) that dictate how many actions they can take in a round. The system also allows for reactions, letting participants respond to actions taken against them.\n\nDifferent elements interact in unique ways, leading to advantages or disadvantages in combat. The GM must account for these interactions when elemental magic interacts, influencing the outcome of actions and reactions.\n\nThe combat arena can undergo changes due to elemental magic or other factors, and terrain features can be used strategically by participants to gain an advantage or hinder opponents. Environmental conditions, such as weather, can also influence the effectiveness of certain elemental abilities.\n\nSkills progress from single element skills to double and triple element skills. Skills consume two resources: mana (related to INT and magic power output) and focus (related to WIS and skill complexity). Skills in this elemental system can allow the element to flow through the user, manipulate the element present in the environment, materialize and control the element, or imbue an object with the element.\n\nEach character can have a unique special ability that can be used once per combat, which can be a game-changer if used strategically.\n\nDefense is calculated based exclusively on character level, and defense-enhancing mechanics are contained within skills. For instance, using an ice barrier could raise the defense level by 3 while the barrier is active.\n\nOverall, the elemental combat system in your game offers a strategic and dynamic experience, where players must consider elemental interactions, terrain alterations, and skill progression to gain an advantage in combat.",

Overview**::\nThe combat system is designed for a single-player experience and is turn-based. It emphasizes strategic planning through a Declaration Phase, followed by an Execution Phase. Participants have a set number of Action Points (AP) that dictate how many actions they can take in a round. The system also allows for reactions, letting participants respond to actions taken against them.\n\n **a. Declaration Phase**::\n- **GM (Game Master)** presents the combat scenario, including terrain alterations & environmental factors, to the player.\n- The player declares their intended actions for the round without spending AP.\n- NPCs (Non-Player Characters) also have their actions declared by the GM, either predetermined or based on the situation.\n\n **b. Initiative Chain**::\n- The order of actions is determined based on the nature of declared actions, character stats, or other relevant factors.\n\n **c. Execution Phase**::\n- Actions are executed in the order determined by the Initiative Chain.\n- Dice rolls determine the success of actions with variable outcomes.\n- AP is spent regardless of the success or failure of an action.\n- After each action, opponents can choose to react, spending AP.\n- Reactions can be based on the outcome of the dice rolls, the nature of the actions taken, or elemental interactions.\n\n **d. End of Round**::\n- Once all participants have exhausted their AP or choose not to act further, the round ends.\n- All participants reset their AP for the next round.\n- Damage rolls are made for any successful hits, and effects are applied.\n\n **3. Action Points (AP)**::\n- Each participant has a set number of AP per round.\n- Actions have varying AP costs.\n- Reactions also cost AP.\n\n **4. Reactions**::\n- Participants can react to actions taken during the Execution Phase.\n- The ability to react is determined by the outcome of the dice rolls, the nature of the actions taken, elemental interactions, or other relevant factors.\n\n **5. Dice Rolls**::\n- Dice rolls (typically d20) determine the success, failure, or degree of success for actions.\n- Modifiers can be applied based on character stats, elemental advantages, or situational factors.\n- The GM informs the player of any advantages or disadvantages before rolls are made.\n\n **6. GM and Player Interaction**::\n- The GM presents the combat scenario and asks the player for their declarations.\n- The player declares their chain of actions.\n- The GM computes the results of all declared actions, rolls all relevant dice, and initiates the reaction chain.\n- The player is informed of actions taken against them and is given the opportunity to react.\n- The GM rolls for the outcomes of reactions and informs the player of the results.\n- Once all actions and reactions are resolved, the GM concludes the round.\n\n **7. Terrain Alterations & Environmental Factors**::\n- The combat arena can undergo changes due to elemental magic or other factors.\n- Terrain features can be used strategically by participants to gain an advantage or hinder opponents.\n- Environmental conditions, such as weather, can influence the effectiveness of certain elemental abilities.\n\n **8. Elemental Interactions**::\n- Different elements interact in unique ways, leading to advantages or disadvantages in combat.\n- The GM must account for these interactions when elemental magic interacts, influencing the outcome of actions and reactions.\n\n **9. Skill Progression**::\n- Skills progress from single element skills to double and triple element skills.\n- Skills consume two resources: mana (related to INT and magic power output) and focus (related to WIS and skill complexity).\n- Skills in this elemental system can:\n  1. Allow the element to flow through the user.\n  2. Manipulate the element present in the environment.\n  3. Materialize the element and control it.\n  4. Imbue an object with the element, such as a weapon.\n\n **10. Team Combats & Combo Moves**::\n- When accompanied by a friendly NPC, the PC can request the NPC to act in a certain way. The NPC's compliance and the success of the idea depend on the PC's affinity with the NPC and the feasibility of the request.\n- The PC can chain actions to form combos, but opponents may react and potentially break the combo.\n\n **11. Special Abilities**::\n- Each character can have a unique special ability that can be used once per combat. This ability can be a game-changer if used strategically.\n\n **12. Movement & Opportunity Attack System**::\n- The traditional movement and opportunity attack systems are replaced by the reaction system.\n- There are no specific rules limiting PC movement in combat. However, the GM will determine if a movement action warrants a reaction from one or more opponents.\n\n **13. Death's Door Mechanic**::\n- When the PC's hit points reach 0, they are limited to 1 AP per turn.\n- The hit point counter goes negative until -3 hit points.\n- Reaching -3 hit points results in the character's permanent death.\n\n **14. Hit Points Mechanic**::\n- Traditional life points and damage roll mechanics are replaced.\n- Each successful hit translates to -1 hit point.\n- Skills that \"do more damage\" will deal multiple hits, but each individual hit requires a separate roll.\n\n **15. Defense Level Mechanic**::\n- Defense is calculated based exclusively on character level.\n- Defense-enhancing mechanics are contained within skills. For instance, using an ice barrier could raise the defense level by 3 while the barrier is active.\n\n **16. Influence Points Mechanic**::\n- The PC can attempt to influence party members.\n- The affinity mechanic is replaced with Influence Points, which reset every turn like AP.\n- Influence Points are used to command party members to produce synergizing actions.\n\n **Sample Character Stat Block - PC**:\n**Name:** Drakin\n**Element:** Shadow\n**Weapon:** Katana\n**Level:** 3\n| Stat  | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| STR   | 14    |\n| DEX   | 17    |\n| CON   | 8     |\n| INT   | 15    |\n| WIS   | 18    |\n| CHA   | 14    |\n10 + (LEVEL - 2) = DEFENSE LEVEL = '11'\n((DEX - 10)/2) +  2= ACTION POINTS = '5'\nINT * 2 = MANA POINTS = '30'\nCON = LIFE POINTS = '8'\nWIS * 2 = FOCUS POINTS = '36'\n(CHA - 10)/2 = INFLUENCE POINTS = '2'\n(STR - 10)/2 = BONUS TO WEAPON ATTACK ROLL = '2'\n**DEFENSE LEVEL:** 11\n**ACTION POINTS:** 5\n**MANA POINTS:** 30\n**LIFE POINTS:** 8\n**FOCUS POINTS:** 36\n**INFLUENCE POINTS:** 2\n**BONUS TO WEAPON ATTACK ROLL:** 2\n\n **1.

As they advance, they gain access to more elements and archetypes, culminating in powerful ultimate skills that harness the synergy of all three chosen elements or the full capabilities of a single element.\n\n First Block (Tier 1):\nContains nodes with one element and one archetype, offering basic skills.  \nExample: light node - basic healing spell.\n\n Second Block (Tier 2):\nContains nodes with two elements and skills that combine two archetypes.  \nExample: light-wind node - healing spell with a gust of wind that pushes enemies away.\n\n Third Block (Tier 3):\nContains nodes with three elements, offering skills that combine all three archetypes and also introduces \"Ultimates\" - powerful skills that optimize all three elements for a single potent effect.  \nExample: light-wind-sound node - a grand healing spell with wind damage that deafens, and as an ultimate: a blinding flash and deafening bang with strong winds to completely disorient enemies.\n\n Effects:\nAs characters progress, they unlock a variety of effects such as attack, defense, heal, CC, movement speed, extra action, repositioning, AoE vs single target, and status boosts.\n\n Character Archetypes:\nCharacters evolve from basic roles to multifaceted masters, transitioning from healers to damage dealers and tanks based on their chosen skills and elements.\n\n Player Choice:\nPlayers can choose elements, skills, and archetypes to create unique characters, with the freedom to mix and match as they progress. That is not a fixed system but an AI-powered one. The AI will both analyze passively how the user plays and synergy with his weapon, stats, and profession choice while crafting new skills, and the user can actively describe skills he would like to train and learn to the AI.\n...\n---END #18---",
