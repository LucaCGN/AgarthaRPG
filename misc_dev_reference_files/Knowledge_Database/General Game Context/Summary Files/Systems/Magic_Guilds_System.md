## Mage Class Ranking System

Mages in Agartha are ranked based on their skill and power, assessed through a grading system that ranges from E to SSS. The distribution of mages according to their ranks is as follows:

- **E (20%):** Beginner level. These mages are just starting their magical journey.
- **D (15%):** Intermediate. These mages have some experience but still have a lot to learn.
- **C (15%):** Advanced. These mages have a solid understanding of magic.
- **B (10%):** Expert. Exceptional skill but not yet a master.
- **A (5%):** Master. These mages are highly skilled and well-respected.
- **S (2.5%):** Elite. These mages are among the best in their field.
- **SS (1.5%):** Legendary. A level reached by very few.
- **SSS (1%):** Mythical. These mages are almost like gods in their command of magic.

This grading system reflects the skill distribution among mages, with only 10% ever reaching the rank of S or higher, and half never achieving a rank above B.
