The notebook demonstrates how to create a group chat using AutoGen's conversable agents. These agents can be powered by LLM, tools, or humans and can perform tasks collectively via automated chat.

#### Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- AutoGen library (`pip install pyautogen`)

#### Key Concepts

1. **API Endpoint Configuration**: The notebook starts by setting up the API endpoint configurations using the `config_list_from_json` function. It looks for an environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" or a JSON file with the same name.

2. **Agent Construction**: 
    - `UserProxyAgent`: Represents a human admin and initiates the chat.
    - `AssistantAgent`: Represents roles like a coder or a product manager.
    - `GroupChat`: Manages the group chat involving multiple agents.
    - `GroupChatManager`: Manages the overall group chat session.

    ```python
    llm_config = {"config_list": config_list_gpt4, "seed": 42}
    user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
        name="User_proxy",
        system_message="A human admin.",
        code_execution_config={"last_n_messages": 2, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
        human_input_mode="TERMINATE"
    )
    coder = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="Coder", llm_config=llm_config)
    pm = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="Product_manager", system_message="Creative in software product ideas.", llm_config=llm_config)
    groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, coder, pm], messages=[], max_round=12)
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)
    ```

3. **Starting the Chat**: The chat is initiated by the `UserProxyAgent` with a specific message. The chat can be terminated by typing `exit`.

    ```python
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message="Find a latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.")
    ```

### Notebook 2: AutoGen Task Allocation Example

#### Overview

This notebook showcases how to allocate tasks among multiple agents using AutoGen. It demonstrates the distribution of tasks and monitoring of task completion.

#### Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- AutoGen library (`pip install pyautogen`)

#### Key Concepts

1. **Task Definition**: The notebook begins by defining a list of tasks that need to be completed. Each task is represented as a dictionary with specific attributes like `task_id`, `description`, and `status`.

    ```python
    tasks = [
        {"task_id": 1, "description": "Data collection", "status": "pending"},
        {"task_id": 2, "description": "Data preprocessing", "status": "pending"},
        // ...
    ]
    ```

2. **Agent Construction**: 
    - `TaskAllocator`: Allocates tasks to agents and monitors their status.
    - `WorkerAgent`: Represents a worker responsible for completing tasks.
    - `OrchestratorAgent`: Manages the overall task allocation and monitoring.

    ```python
    task_allocator = autogen.TaskAllocator(tasks=tasks)
    worker1 = autogen.WorkerAgent(name="Worker1", task_allocator=task_allocator)
    worker2 = autogen.WorkerAgent(name="Worker2", task_allocator=task_allocator)
    orchestrator = autogen.OrchestratorAgent(name="Orchestrator", task_allocator=task_allocator)
    ```

3. **Task Allocation**: The `TaskAllocator` agent allocates tasks to `WorkerAgent`s based on their availability and skill set.

    ```python
    task_allocator.allocate_tasks()
    ```

4. **Monitoring**: The `OrchestratorAgent` monitors the status of tasks and can re-allocate them if necessary.

    ```python
    orchestrator.monitor_tasks()
    ```

#### Relevance to Our Project

- **Task Definition**: The way tasks are defined can be adapted for our cooking app project, where each task could represent a feature or a sub-feature that needs to be developed.
  
- **Agent Construction**: The `TaskAllocator` and `WorkerAgent` classes can be used as a basis for our worker agents like Agent 2 and Agent 3, who are responsible for generating app features and translating them into tasks.
  
- **Monitoring**: The monitoring functionality aligns well with the role of our orchestrator agents (Agent 1 and Agent 6), who are responsible for setting goals and monitoring progress.
