**RiftDev Project Documentation: AutoGen Framework Integration**

---

### **Introduction**

The RiftDev project aims to design and develop a mobile app using the AutoGen framework. This documentation provides an overview of the current code structure, the integration of the AutoGen framework, and the planned additions to the project.

---

### **1. AutoGen Framework Overview**

AutoGen is a Python library designed for creating and managing agents. The core components of the framework include:

- **Agent Class**: Central to the framework, allowing for the creation of agents.
- **Message Class**: Facilitates inter-agent communication.
- **CoordinationContext**: Orchestrates agent coordination, goal setting, and monitoring.

---

### **2. Current Code Structure**

The current code structure is organized as follows:

- **Initialization**: The `CoordinationContext` is initialized to manage agent coordination.
- **Agent Definitions**: Multiple agents are defined, each with specific roles:
  - **OrchestratorAgent**: Manages goals, sets tasks, monitors progress, and adjusts tasks.
  - **FeatureAgent**: Generates app features.
  - **TaskAgent**: Translates features into tasks.
  - **ValidationAgent**: Validates tasks and identifies issues.
  - **CommunicationAgent**: Manages inter-agent communication.
  - **UserProxyAgent**: Represents the user and manages the interaction with the system.
- **Tech Pairs Data**: Contains pairs of frontend and backend technologies suitable for different app types.
- **Main Function**: Drives the app planning process, including tech pair selection, agent initialization, and chat initiation.

### **3. Planned Additions**

The planned additions to the code include:

- **Markdown File Creation**: Logic to create markdown files and update the list of created files.
- **App Structuring**: Logic to structure the app based on the final folder structure, tech stack, and UX design.
- **Pseudo Code Generation**: Logic to generate pseudo code for the project.
- **File Coding Order**: Logic to define the order of coding files.
- **Final Summary**: Logic to generate the final summary, performance report, and guidelines for further development.
- **Dynamic Task Creation**: Logic to translate features into tasks dynamically.
- **Task Validation**: Logic to validate tasks and identify issues.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Logic to manage communication between agents.
- **Orchestrator Logic**: Additional logic for fixed goals vs. dynamic tasks and real-time analytics.

### **4. Integration with AutoGen Framework**

The integration of the AutoGen framework into the RiftDev project is evident in the following areas:

- **Agent Inheritance**: Each agent inherits from the `Agent` class provided by AutoGen.
- **Act Method**: The behavior of each agent is defined in the `act` method.
- **Messaging**: The `Message` class is used for inter-agent communication, with methods like `send_message` and `receive_messages` implemented.
- **Coordination**: The `CoordinationContext` is utilized for orchestrating the agents, with methods like `set_goal` and `wait_for` used for goal setting and monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: The `ValidationAgent` is designed to handle errors using the features provided by AutoGen.
- **Optimization**: Advanced features of the `CoordinationContext` are used for optimization.

---

### **5. Best Practices**

The RiftDev project aims to adhere to the following best practices:

- **Clean Code**: The code is structured for efficiency and maintainability.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time analytics and feedback loops are implemented for continuous monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: Common issues are identified, and solutions are provided to address them.

---

### **Conclusion**

The RiftDev project leverages the AutoGen framework to design and develop a mobile app. The current code structure provides a foundation for the app planning process, and the planned additions aim to enhance the functionality and user experience. By adhering to best practices and integrating the features of the AutoGen framework, the project aims to achieve a robust and efficient mobile app design and development process.
