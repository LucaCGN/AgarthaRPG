ELEMENTAL MANDALA SKILL TREE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

    Summary of the Elemental Skill System: In this skill system, characters progress through a tiered system of elemental mastery. As they advance, they gain access to more elements and archetypes, culminating in powerful ultimate skills that harness the synergy of all three chosen elements.

    Skill tree: The skill tree is divided into three sections, each containing different types of nodes based on the number of elements and archetypes:
        Inner Circle (Tier 1): Contains nodes with one element and one archetype, offering basic skills. Example: light node - basic healing spell.
        Midward Circle (Tier 2): Contains nodes with two elements and skills that combine two archetypes. Example: light-wind node - healing spell with a gust of wind that pushes enemies away.
        Outward Circle (Tier 3): Contains nodes with three elements, offering skills that combine all three archetypes and also introduces "Ultimates" - powerful skills that optimize all three elements for a single potent effect. Example: light-wind-sound node - a grand healing spell with wind damage that deafens, and as an ultimate: a blinding flash and deafening bang with strong winds to completely disorient enemies.

    Effects: As characters progress, they unlock a variety of effects such as attack, defense, heal, CC, movement speed, extra action, repositioning, AoE vs single target, and status boosts.

    Character archetypes: Characters evolve from basic roles to multifaceted masters, transitioning from healers to damage dealers and tanks based on their chosen skills and elements.

    Player choice: Players can choose elements, skills, and archetypes to create unique characters, with the freedom to mix and match as they progress.

    LLM generation: Generates unique skills based on elements, playstyle, archetype, and tier.

    Examples of characters:
        Tier 1 characters: Limited to 1 element and 1 archetype.
            Light mage: Basic healer with simple light-based healing spells.
        Tier 2 characters: Can combine 2 elements and 2 archetypes.
            Fire-metal mage: A damage dealer and tank, using fire for offense and metal for defense.
            Wind-sound mage: A healer and damage dealer, using wind for healing and sound for offense.
        Tier 3 characters: Combine 3 elements and 3 archetypes, with access to ultimates.
            Light-wind-sound mage: A master of healing, damage, and tanking. Ultimate: A blinding flash and deafening bang with strong winds to completely disorient enemies.
            Fire-metal-magnetism mage: A master of damage, tanking, and control. Ultimate: A fiery explosion that pulls enemies in and encases them in metal.
            Spirit-chaos-wood mage: A master of healing, control, and tanking. Ultimate: A spiritual aura that sows chaos among enemies and fortifies allies with wooden shields.

Tiered progression allows characters to evolve from basic elemental users to grandmasters, offering a rewarding journey of growth and specialization.
